Create a transformation module **FamiliesToPersons_All** that converts a **Families** model into a **Persons** model.  

Define helper functions on **Member**:  
- **familyLastName()** to determine the last name from father, mother, son, or daughter.  
- **isFemale()** to check if the member is a mother or daughter.  
- **isMale()** to check if the member is a father or son.  

Add two transformation rules:  
- **Member2Male**: map a male **Member** to a **Male** with fullName as firstName + familyLastName.  
- **Member2Female**: map a female **Member** to a **Female** with the same fullName logic.

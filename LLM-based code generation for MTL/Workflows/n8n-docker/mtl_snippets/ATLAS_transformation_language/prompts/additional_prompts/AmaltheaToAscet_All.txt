Create a transformation module named **AmaltheaToAscet_All** that maps models from **Amalthea** to **Ascet**.  
Define a rule **ComponentContainer2AscetModule** that transforms each **ComponentContainer** into an **AscetModule**, collecting its tasks and converting them into **SoftwareTask** elements using a helper.  
Define a rule **TaskRoot2SoftwareTask** that transforms only top-level **Task** elements (those without a container) into **SoftwareTask**, copying their name.  
Also define a rule **Task2SoftwareTask** that converts any **Task** into a **SoftwareTask**, again mapping the name attribute.

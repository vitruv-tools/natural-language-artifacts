Create a transformation named **networkToGraph** that reacts to changes in the **network** model and applies corresponding updates in the **graph** model. Define a reaction called **ComponentRenamed** that triggers whenever the `name` attribute of a **Component** in the network is replaced. This reaction should call a routine named **renameEntity**, which retrieves the corresponding **Entity** in the graph and updates its `name` attribute to match the new name of the network component.

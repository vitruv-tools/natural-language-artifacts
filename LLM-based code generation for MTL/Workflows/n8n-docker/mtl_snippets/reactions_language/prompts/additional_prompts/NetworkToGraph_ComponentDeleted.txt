Create a transformation called **networkToGraph** that reacts to changes in the **network** model and executes actions in the **graph** model. Define a reaction named **ComponentDeleted** that triggers after a **Component** is deleted in the network. This reaction should call a routine named **deleteEntity**. In the **deleteEntity** routine, retrieve the corresponding **Entity** in the graph, then remove that entity and also remove the correspondence between the deleted component and the entity.

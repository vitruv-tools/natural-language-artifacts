Create a transformation called **familiesToPersons** that reacts to changes in the **families** model and executes actions in the **persons** model. Define a reaction named **DeletedMember** that triggers after a **Member** is deleted in families. This reaction should call a routine named **deletePerson**. In the routine, retrieve the corresponding **Person** and its **Family**, then remove the person object and clear all correspondences between the deleted member, the person, and the family.
